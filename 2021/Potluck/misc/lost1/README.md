So my friend and I where taking a trip and I seem to have lost him and now I don't know where I am. He's been looking all over for me, If only I knew the streetname.

The flag is in the format: `10an{Country-City-Street}` (If there is space in any of the names, replace it with an underscore)

Example flag:

`10an{Germany-Düsseldorf-Oberkasseler_Brücke}`
