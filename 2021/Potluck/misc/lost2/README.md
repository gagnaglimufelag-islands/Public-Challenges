This is emberassing, but I got lost again and I don't want to bother my friend. Oh well, guess I'll just start looking.

The flag is in the format: `10an{Country-City-Street}` (If there is space in any of the names, replace it with an underscore)

Example flag:

`10an{Germany-Düsseldorf-Oberkasseler_Brücke}`
