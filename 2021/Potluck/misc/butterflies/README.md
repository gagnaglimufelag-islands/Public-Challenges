I wrote this letter to a friend of mine the other day.
I calculated the sha256 hash of the file so my friend could verify the content,
because my hardware has been acting up lately.
Occasionally letters change in my files, although never more than 4.

Maybe it's due to all the [butterflies](https://xkcd.com/378) in my neighborhood?

SHA256 hash of the letter:
```
