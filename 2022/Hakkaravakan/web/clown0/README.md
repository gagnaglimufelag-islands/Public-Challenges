This company ClownSec claims to Secure your application with the help of 
their security eXpErTs yet they keep missing the simplest vulns. 

They give all their clients which have zero vulnerabilities a certificate
to certify that their application is vulnerability free. 

Can you prove them wrong and show that this certificate is completely meaningless?
