Your friend recently learned about repeated key XOR encryption and thought it
was cool. He felt inspired and created his own repeated key AND-OR
encryption, which produces two ciphertexts which, by his logic, makes is
twice as secure. The only drawback is that he cannot find a way to decrypt
the ciphertexts. Can you help?
