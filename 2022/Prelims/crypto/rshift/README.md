My friend just started studying cryptography. He's fascinated by shift
ciphers, but recognizes that their flaw is that they are easily broken. But
he has come up with a way to make them more secure. He simply applies the
shift cipher 1,000,000,000 times, each time with a random key, to obtain
the ciphertext. That way, cracking the cipher will become highly
impractical.
