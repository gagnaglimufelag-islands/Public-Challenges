We need your help again! We hired this IT guy, which seemed fine at first, but
turned out he favored tabs over spaces. When we found out, we immediately
fired him, of course. Unfortunately, he didn't take the news well, and
proceded to destroy the flag decryption repository.

It appears he cloned the repository, made some random changes and overwrote
the repository on our git server. Due to the sensitive nature of this
repository, no one had a local copy.

We managed to recover the following folder from his hard drive. Please help
us, you are our only hope of recovering the flag.
