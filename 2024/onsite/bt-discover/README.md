My friend Joe from the office has been bragging about setting up a super secret secure network.
He recently started reading articles about network vulnerabilities and has not stopped talking about
how he would never set up a vulnerable service in his life. Especialy such as the one where a casino was hacked through a
vulnerable bluetooth device. He is just too smart for that. I highly doubt that though... I zoned out while he was explaining his super secure
setup to be but remember something about some gap and advertising... am not sure how this is connected though.
