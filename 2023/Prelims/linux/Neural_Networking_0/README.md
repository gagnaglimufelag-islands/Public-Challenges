You have been granted access to a top-secret server where one of the world's
most advanced language models resides: DALLE. It appears that the credentials
to access the server have been leaked or hacked, as you only have access to
the DALLE user account.

DALLE is a brilliant artist who specializes in generating breathtaking
images from textual descriptions. It's said that it can conjure up images
of anything you desire with just a few words.

As a contestant, you must navigate the server, solve DALLE's challenges,
and prove that you have what it takes to win the AI Challenge. But beware,
the legendary rivalry between DALLE and its arch-nemesis, GPT, still
simmers beneath the surface, and the challenges ahead may not be as
straightforward as they seem.

Now, the first flag is hidden, but not really. Can you find it?
