Netcat, or "nc", is a networking utility that can be used for debugging,
file transfer, and port scanning. It runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux, and
can create TCP and UDP connections. In a CTF, Netcat can be used to solve
network-based challenges, such as connecting to remote servers and sending
or receiving data. Beginners can practice with simple challenges to become
familiar with Netcat's syntax and options.
