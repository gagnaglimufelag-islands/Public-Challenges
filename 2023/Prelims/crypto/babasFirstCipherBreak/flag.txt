gg{Excuse me sir but is that original post you made right there loss? Now hold on, it might sound ridiculous but bare with me here. You see  there's 4 panels. Let's count them  1 2 3 4 panels! And you know what else has 4 panels ? That's right, loss does! But i'm not done yet, you see in the first panel there is 1 object  positioned slightly to the left. Should I even continue? I guess I will as you still don't understand. I should clarify this is a level 5 loss meme so I don't expect you to understand it. Anyways in the second panel there are 2 objects next to each other with one being slightly below the other. In the 3rd panel another 2 objects are present right next to each other. Finally, there are, yet again, 2 objects which form an L shape. Everything looks like it's adding up therefore it HAS to be loss!! You need to make it less obvious next time if you want it to be more funny._9f11cd31f7}
