The challenge name is hinting that this is a tree. The challenge takes in inputand inserts each character of a string into a binary search tree and then traverses the tree in order.

Your input must contain 10 words and each word must fulfill the following conditions:
* Between 5 and 10 characters
* `word == sorted(word)`
* Each word must be unique

Once you have found an input that fulfills these conditions you can send the words separated by underscores to the server and get the flag back.
